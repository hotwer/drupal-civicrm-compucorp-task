  <description><![CDATA[This extension should create a new CiviCRM contact “tab” which should only be shown for Organisation contacts.

    This tab should display activity records for contacts which have a relationship record with the organisation contact and where the related contact is an individual contact only.

    For additional flexibility add a settings page (that is only accessible by the administrator) that allows the administrator to:

    - specify which relationship types should be included by the new tab
    - which activity types should be included by the new tab

    i.e. If I set to only include those with employer of/ employee of relationship type, then only activities from contacts who are related to the Organisation by way of this relationship type should be included]]></description>
